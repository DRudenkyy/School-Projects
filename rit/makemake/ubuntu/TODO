Add include files -I and properly put path in dependencies
  dependencies for specific includes in other directories? (only "")

What about .o files without a corresponding .c or .cpp file? (check for main?)

Add a dependencies file -> exe: m.o x.o
  Properly handle .exe files on windows - detect platform in gmakemake?
  have a wmakemake <---
  What about non-gnu compilers on windows?
  Perhaps a -windows flag?
  Check if invoked with .exe extension? - doesn't work

Make type of build depend on name of file makemake or gmakemake or smakemake

Handle .S files using cpp to make a .s file? (with -s flag)

Separate flage between gnu and CC so compilers and linkers do not share flags?

-s make .s files from .S files using cpp
-w assume executables have .exe suffix
-g use gnu compilers
-I include directories with -I flag and include dependencies???
